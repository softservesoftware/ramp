# Rapid Web Application Modernization Program (RAMP)

## Problem
Currently the US government spends $73B annually on NAICS 5415 (Computer Systems Design and Related Services). Between 2019 and 2024, this has been growing at a 9.22% CAGR. If left unchecked this will grow to roughly $100B by 2028. 

We believe, of this annual spend, about 15% of it constitutes of basic web development work for relatively simple websites that serve database read/write operations. These systems are built using legacy technologies and are massively expensive to upkeep from a cost and talent perspective. If this assumption is correct, this would represent about $11B of annual spend for the upkeep of legacy technologies.
