# Rapid Web Application Modernization Program (RAMP)

## Problem
Currently the US government spends $73B annually on NAICS 5415 (Computer Systems Design and Related Services). Between 2019 and 2024, this has been growing at a 9.22% CAGR. If left unchecked this will grow to roughly $100B by 2028. 

We believe, of this annual spend, about 15% of it constitutes of basic web development work for relatively simple websites that serve database read/write operations. These systems are built using legacy technologies and are massively expensive to upkeep from a cost and talent perspective. If this assumption is correct, this would represent about $11B of annual spend for the upkeep of legacy technologies.

## Solution
I propose the Rapid Application Modernization Program (RAMP). This program will be a 6 month program that will rapidly modernize the existing legacy web applications using modern technologies, personel, and processes that exist in the private sector. With this program, we beleive that we can deliver these systems at a 80% savings to current costs.

### Cost 
This solution is designed to be offered at 0 net costs to the government. The program will be compensated 100% based on performance as it relates to the cost savings and delivery timeline. The program compensates the team for the cost savings realized. The program charges the goverment 50% of realized annual cost savings in year 1, 25% in year 2, and 12.5% in year 3.

Example:

$100M annual contract for legacy web application development. 

| Type (Existing vs RAMP)       | Cost year 1 | Cost year 2 | Cost year 3 | Cost year 4 | Cost Total |
|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Existing                      | $100M       | $100M       | $100M       | $100M       | $400M      |
| RAMP                          | $0M         | $50M        | $25M        | $12.5M      | $87.5M     |
| Net Savings                   | $0M         | $50M        | $75M        | $87.5M      | $212.5M    |

With this approach, we believe that in many cases, the RAMP program can be completed within the same fiscal year. This means that the US government can begin realizing cost savings within the same fiscal year. We will also complete the efforts at $0 up front cost to the government on a strictly performance based model. This ensures that the US government is not taking on any risk related to the program and that the program is only successful if the government realizes cost savings.


### Timeline
The program will be a 3-4 month program that will be broken down into 3 phases:

1. **Discovery**: 1 Month - This phase will involve the discovery of the existing legacy web applications and the assessment of the current state of the systems.
2. **Modernization**: 1-2 Months - This phase will involve the rebuilding of the existing legacy web applications using modern technologies, personel, and processes that exist in the private sector.
3. **Transfer**: 1 Month - This phase will involve the transfer of the modernized web applications to the government. This includes documentation, training, and a handover of the modernized systems so lower cost resources can maintain the systems long term.
